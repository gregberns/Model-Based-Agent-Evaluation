<!-- Note: Generally the technical specs were good. There were a couple choices that were interesting, but I was mostly concerned with the overall structure of the project. If we need to change the structure of internal modules - we should be able to do so.

For example, it wants to use Jinja templates. I haven't worked with them, but have heard of them for years - should be a robust way of scaffolding out file structures. Lets go for it.

One place that I am a little concerned about is the event emitting framework. I used that concept in another project, and it was really useful. I think we'll have to formalize it a bit - but I think we should be able to retro-fit changes. Also I'd love to figure out how to get events from within the Google LLM/Agent code, like if the model goes into reasoning, but we can figure that out later.

The contents of the project plan (`docs/project-plan`) has really come together nicely.

Lets now put together a task list of the actions we want to perform.

The list can contain both code changes to be made, but also tests to write and other mechanisms to validate what we're working on.

As we perform tasks on the list, we'll want to check items as completed.

Make sure to be thorough and think through the order of steps that need to be completed.

Lets write the task list to somewhere that makes sense, then write a summary to `13_task-list_out.md`
