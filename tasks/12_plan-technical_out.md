# Technical Plan Generation Summary

This document summarizes the creation of the detailed technical specifications for the project.

## 1. Summary of Actions Taken

I have translated the refined project plan into a set of detailed technical specification documents. For each of the five core components of the project, a `__tech.md` file has been created in `docs/project-plan/`.

These technical specifications provide a concrete blueprint for implementation, covering:
-   **Architecture and Design:** The high-level design patterns and principles for each component.
-   **File and Class Structure:** The proposed file layout, class names, and key methods.
-   **Code Examples:** Snippets of Python code to illustrate the core logic, class signatures, and data structures (e.g., Pydantic models).
-   **Implementation Order:** A step-by-step guide for how to build each component, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
-   **Best Practices:** Explicit callouts to how the design adheres to principles like "Library First," SOLID, DRY, and testability.

## 2. High-Level Technical Approach

The technical plan solidifies the following key architectural decisions:

-   **Pydantic for Schema Validation:** We will use Pydantic to ensure the `plugin-profile.yaml` is always valid and to provide a reliable data model for the rest of the system.
-   **Composable, Library-First Design:** The entire framework is designed as a set of small, reusable, and independently testable Python classes and modules.
-   **Event-Driven Observability:** An event emitter system will be used to decouple the core orchestration logic from logging and evaluation concerns. Tools will be wrapped to emit events, which listeners can then capture for tracing or testing.
-   **TDD-Centric Development:** The implementation order is designed to build the testing and evaluation infrastructure *first*. The Virtual Plugin Factory and Evaluation Harness will be built before the main Orchestrator, ensuring that we can test our components as we build them.
-   **Deferred UI:** The user-facing CLI and `Makefile` will be the last components to be built, ensuring that the core library is stable and robust before a user interface is added.

## 3. Next Steps: Implementation

The project has now been planned from a high-level concept down to a detailed, actionable technical specification. The path forward is to begin **Phase 1** of the implementation as defined in the Master Plan and detailed in these technical documents.

The immediate next action is to start by creating the `packages/framework/schema.py` file and its corresponding unit tests.
