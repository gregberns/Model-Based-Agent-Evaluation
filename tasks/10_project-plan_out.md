# Project Plan Generation Summary

This document summarizes the project planning phase and outlines the high-level path forward.

## 1. Summary of Actions Taken

I have analyzed the complete history of the project's conceptual development, from the initial problem definition to the detailed architectural discussions. Based on this analysis, I have:

1.  **Deconstructed the Project:** Broken the system down into five core, individually workable components:
    *   Plugin Model & Structure
    *   Orchestrator Framework
    *   Agent Playbooks
    *   Virtual Plugin Factory & Testing
    *   User Interface & CLI
2.  **Created Detailed Specifications:** For each component, I have created a detailed specification document. These documents capture the requirements, architectural decisions, and tradeoffs discussed throughout the project's history.
3.  **Organized the Plan:** All specification documents have been saved to the `docs/project-plan/` directory.
4.  **Created a Master Plan:** A high-level `00_master_plan.md` has been created to unify the individual specifications and define a clear, phased implementation order.

## 2. High-Level Project Goals

The objective is to build a scalable, agent-driven system for managing a large library of software plugins. The core features of this system are:

-   **Automation:** An AI Agent will be used to automate complex software maintenance tasks like bug fixes and feature development.
-   **Standardization:** The agent will follow standardized, version-controlled **Playbooks** to ensure consistent and reliable execution.
-   **Observability & Testability:** The entire system is designed to be verifiable. The agent's actions are logged to an **Execution Trace**, which can be asserted against in a test harness that runs on disposable **Virtual Plugins**.

## 3. Next Steps: Implementation

The project is now ready to move into the implementation phase. The `00_master_plan.md` document outlines the recommended, phased approach to development, starting with the core framework and validation loop.

The next immediate actions are to begin implementing **Phase 1** of the plan:
1.  Define the Pydantic schema for the `plugin-profile.yaml`.
2.  Build the basic scaffolding for the Orchestrator application.
3.  Implement the observable tool wrappers using Composio SWE-Kit.
4.  Build the Virtual Plugin Factory.
5.  Create the test harness to validate playbook executions.
