# Plan Refinement Summary

This document summarizes the refinements made to the project plan based on your feedback and highlights key architectural decisions and discussion points.

## 1. Summary of Changes

Based on your input, I have made the following critical corrections and refinements to the project plan documents:

1.  **Removed External Tool Dependencies:** All references to `Composio` and `SWE-Kit` have been removed. The plan now correctly specifies that we will use our own `GeminiAgent` and its associated toolset (`edit_file`, `read_file`, etc.) located in the `packages/plugin_manager_agent` directory.
2.  **Revised Implementation Order:** The Master Plan has been updated to prioritize the development of the Virtual Plugin system and the Evaluation Harness. This enables a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for the entire framework, allowing us to build and validate components in small, iterative steps.
3.  **Refined Orchestrator Architecture:** The Orchestrator is now defined as a composable library of reusable modules. Its core responsibility is to wrap our own agent tools with an event-emitting system, which provides the necessary observability for logging and evaluation.
4.  **Simplified Project Structure:** The concept of a master `/plugin_profiles` directory has been removed. The `plugin-profile.yaml` will reside within each plugin's directory. The testing/evaluation harness is now planned for a dedicated top-level `/evaluations` directory to distinguish it from unit tests.
5.  **Deferred UI/CLI Development:** The plan for the `Makefile` and CLI has been updated to reflect that these are secondary priorities to be implemented only after the core library components are built and tested. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) features are also deferred.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions Moving Forward

The refined plan is now centered on a clear and robust set of technical decisions:

-   **We are building a library first.** The primary output of this project will be a set of composable Python modules (the Orchestrator, the Virtual Plugin Factory, the Evaluation Harness) that can be used programmatically.
-   **We are using our own agent and tools.** This gives us full control and avoids the instability of external, rapidly-changing dependencies. Our custom `edit_file` tool is a core component.
-   **Observability is achieved via an event-based wrapper system.** The Orchestrator will wrap the agent's tools to emit events (`tool_requested`, `tool_completed`). This allows different parts of the system (like a logger or an evaluation harness) to listen and react to the agent's actions without the agent needing to be aware of them.

## 3. Discussion and Path Forward

The refined plan is now technically sound and aligns with the project's core goals. The risk of relying on incorrect assumptions or unstable external libraries has been eliminated.

The immediate path forward is clear and follows the revised **Phase 1** from the Master Plan:
1.  **Implement the Pydantic schema** for `plugin-profile.yaml`.
2.  **Build the Virtual Plugin Factory** to generate testable, mock plugins.
3.  **Develop the Evaluation Harness** to run playbooks and assert against the agent's actions.

This TDD-centric approach ensures that as we build the Orchestrator and integrate the agent in the next phase, we will have a robust framework to immediately verify that it is working as expected.
