<!-- Probably could get the Agent loaded with a set of File System tools via an MCP server, then turn off Gemini's tools via settings. But I want the agent to get there. -->

> The interaction between them is a **Tool-Proxy Model**. The Agent can only achieve its goals by requesting that the Orchestrator use a tool on its behalf.

That idea has not been discussed before. If that's your proposal, you need to fully discuss how you propose how that would be built out, how the tooling would be provided to something like Gemini CLI or Claude Code.

Do not go light on the details - I need to understand exactly how you think your going to swap out the tooling that the agents provide. The tooling we have will need to be as robust as the tools they have. So for example, the Read File, Write File, and Edit File tools will be needed. Are you going to be able to write an implementation as good as the agents have already? I doubt it.

Because Gemini CLI is open source, we could somehow get the tooling code out. But it is written in TypeScript...

If this is the path you want to go, then you need to figure out how we get there.

Alternatively, we could think of other ways to accomplish what we want. We've come a long way down the thought path. Backing up and thinking through some other concepts may be worth while.

## Other Considerations

I haven't even figured out how we'll run the agent in a headless mode because the two best agents (Gemini CLI, Claude Code) I don't think really support that.

Also, is the orchestrator going to execute the agent process and wait for it to complete? Maybe with a timeout?

## Next

There are still some gaps that need to be filled out. Lets figure out a detailed plan to resolve these, then write our thoughts to: 07_software-modeling-concepts-6_out.md
