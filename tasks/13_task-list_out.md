# Task List Generation Summary

I have created a comprehensive, actionable task list for the implementation of the Plugin Manager framework.

## 1. Task List Location and Format

-   **Location:** The task list has been saved to a new `TASKS.md` file in the root of the project directory.
-   **Format:** The list is structured in Markdown with checkboxes (`- [ ]`) to allow for easy tracking of progress.

## 2. Structure and Approach

The task list is organized to follow the phased implementation strategy outlined in the refined Master Project Plan. This ensures a logical, step-by-step development process that prioritizes building a testable foundation first.

-   **Phase 1:** Focuses on creating the Virtual Plugin ecosystem and the Evaluation Harness. This allows us to build and validate the core components in a controlled environment.
-   **Phase 2:** Focuses on building the Orchestrator and integrating the live `GeminiAgent`. The work from Phase 1 enables us to immediately run end-to-end tests on this integration.
-   **Phase 3:** Focuses on enabling the system to work on real plugins and building the user-facing CLI, which is deferred until the core library is proven to be stable and reliable.

For each piece of implementation, a corresponding task to write tests has been included, reinforcing our commitment to a TDD-centric workflow.

## 3. Next Steps

The project is now fully planned, with a high-level strategy, detailed technical specifications, and a concrete, ordered task list. The next step is to begin executing the tasks in `TASKS.md`, starting with **Phase 1**.
