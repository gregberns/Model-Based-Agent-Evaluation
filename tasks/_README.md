Documented here are all of my thoughts as I work through the project. Basically everything will be fed into an agent (Gemini in my case), then fed back into this series of documents.


1) Define the problem, have agent refine and clarify
  * `00_problem-definition_in.md`
1) Refine the results from the previous step. Add some commentary, tweak the language/task to be done
  * `01_problem-definition-refinement_in.md`
1)
