## Issue 2: Agent's `execute` generator does not yield tool calls

**Date:** 2025-07-28

### Problem Description
The `GeminiAgent.execute` method, which is a generator, is not yielding tool calls as expected. When a simple prompt like "List the files" is sent, the agent correctly calls the `list_files` tool internally, but instead of `yield`ing the tool call to the orchestrator, the generator immediately exits, raising a `StopIteration` with the final text response from the model. This prevents the entire event-sourcing and observability framework from functioning.

### Attempts to Resolve

I have tried three different implementations of the `while` loop within the `execute` method, all with the same result:

1.  **Initial Loop:** A simple `while response.function_calls:` loop. This failed because the final response could be in the same turn as a tool call.
2.  **Refactored Loop:** A loop that processed tool calls first, then checked for a final response. This also failed.
3.  **Robust Loop:** A `while True:` loop designed to explicitly handle the history and the different response types. This also failed in the same way.

### Current Status
I am critically blocked. The core function of the agent—to yield tool calls for observation—is not working. I have exhausted my debugging capabilities by refactoring the code. The issue seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of how the `google-genai` library's `generate_content` method interacts with generators and tool calls. I cannot proceed without a different approach or a deeper understanding of the library's internal mechanics.
