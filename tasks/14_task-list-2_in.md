<!-- Forgot to add this detail! I've found having the Agent document as it goes is super helpful when restarting. -->

If we need to restart the Agent and the context is lost, we'll need to provide enough information for the new Agent to continue working through the tasks.

Lets update the task list to have references to the relevant project plan documents - either spec, technical or both.

Also, while we're at it, lets generate a project summary that can additionally be used to spin up a new Agent. We need as much context saved that will be relevant to moving the project forward.
