## Issue 1: Cannot Specify API Version for Gemini Client

**Date:** 2025-07-28

### Problem Description
The end-to-end evaluation test is consistently failing with a `404 models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1beta` error. This indicates that the `google-genai` library is defaulting to a beta API version that does not recognize the standard `gemini-pro` model name.

### Attempts to Resolve

1.  **Initial Assumption:** The model name was incorrect. I tried several variations (`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`, `gemini-pro`), but all resulted in the same error.
2.  **Research:** I searched for a way to specify the API version. The documentation and search results suggested using a `genai.Client` object and passing `http_options=types.HttpOptions(api_version='v1')`.
3.  **Implementation Failure:** I attempted to implement this solution, but I have been unable to find the correct `Client` class within the `google.generativeai` package.
    -   `import google.generativeai as genai; genai.Client` -> `AttributeError`
    -   `from google.generativeai.client import Client` -> `ImportError`

### Current Status
I am currently blocked. I cannot find the correct method to instantiate the Gemini client with a specific API version (`v1`). Without this, the model calls fail, and the end-to-end test cannot be completed. Further investigation into the `google-genai` library's source code or documentation is required to solve this client instantiation issue.
