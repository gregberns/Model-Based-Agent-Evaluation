<!-- Now lets expand our thinking -->

Now I need some help from you, Gemini CLI.

In `./tasks/01_problem-definition-refinement_out.md` there's a pretty good definition of what we want to accomplish, and some of the ways we want to accomplish it.

But I want to expand our thinking. What are other options? How could we approach the problem differently?

Take each section at a time. Think through possible options and ways we could approach it, what the benefits and tradeoffs are to those options, and 

Along the way, lets build up a set of 'ideal states' or kind of a future vision of what the system could do, how it would work, and

Very importantly, we need to define how humans will be involved and interact with it.


Feel free to use a scratch pad to keep track of all your tasks, what your thinking is, and any incremental information that will be helpful.

We'll want to build up justification for our decisions, both technical/architectural,
