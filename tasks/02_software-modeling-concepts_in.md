<!-- This is a bit of a divergence - but want to explore it. I could grab some tooling from OOS projects - or we could build a simulation that could be used to test. -->


In the AI space, there's the term for Digital Twins, but they seem to relate more to modeling physical assets.

What are concepts that help model a software system? How could you create a model if you don't have real data yet?
Usually there are priors - could probably use LLMs to generate data.

How could we build a model of a plugin that we could then use to build and test the system around?

Help me fill in the gaps here. I need some help. Search the internet for some ideas we could use to build on here.
Anticipate where we might be able to go and gather some info that could help us figure out how to leverage an idea
like this.
