<!-- I'm going to bed - so lets commit all the changes, set Gemini to YOLO mode, and hope it doesn't burn too many tokens on a bad assumption. Hopefully all the planning will have helped.

Ok. Now that all looks good. Please start implementing the solution, making sure to follow the task list, following best practices, testing and validating as you go.

If you run into any major issues, or get into a situation where you can't figure something out, please stop.

Act autonomously and achieve as many tasks as you can.

If you run into any issues write them to `15_implement_out.md` and we can review them.
