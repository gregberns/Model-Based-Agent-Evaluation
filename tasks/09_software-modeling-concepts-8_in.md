No we're not going to read the whole file in to context.

We need to take a step back. You have worked yourself into a corner. 

Why do you insist on writing a coding agent by ourselves? This project is not about writing a coding agent.

We have gotten way off topic. 

Lets look at this as an option:

> SWE-Kit: A headless IDE and agent toolkit, swekit is designed for building autonomous coding agents. It features code indexing, Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, and seamless integration with tools like GitHub, Jira, and Slack. It's meant to be run in containerized, headless environments and is compatible with frameworks like CrewAI, LangChain, Autogen, and LlamaIndex

I don't know if we can do the Tool Proxy Model, but it looks like we may get some value out of it.

Do some deep research into "SWE-Kit". What does it have available? Can we customize tools? Can it act as a library?
