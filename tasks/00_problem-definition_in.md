# Plugin Manager

## Problem

What if you needed to maintain a lot of plugins, libraries, or today, a lot of MCP servers? How could you structure a project to help manage those plugins 'at scale' - meaning several hundred (or more)?

What challenges would you run into?

* Resources - only so many hours in a day
* Brain power - hard for a human to understand every plugin
* Error tracking and resolution - Prod errors tracked, debugged, fixed, deployed

## Concept and Structure

Below are rough notes. The idea right now is to just cleanup the notes. Make them concise and easily understandable so we can explore some ideas.

We're working on defining the problem, building out what challenges we'd run into, how we should think through maintenance problems, etc.

We want to think pretty deeply about these issues to make sure to cover as many areas as possible.

Plugin Library Maintainer

Problem: You have a large library of MCP plugins to expose/maintain.

Each will need to be independent of another:
* evolve independently
* file set is versioned
* have different EnvVars
* different interfaces/definitions
But to maintain a large, complex library, they will need to
* Use agents to help maintain the software
  * Plugin has an Agent Context and knowledge base
* Automated Prod error tracking system
  * Errors and logging captured in Prod
  * Agent Context to evaluate errors and issues
* Integration into an Issue tracking system
  * Errors from Prod are aggregated into bug tickets
  * Agent creates Tickets in plugin's "Jira" project
  * "Shared Instruction Context" for Plugin Agent - Templates all agents use to:
    * Debug issues
    * Test issue
    * Document/report issue
    * Fix/Deploy
* The Plugin's Agent takes the "Shared Instruction Context" template, plugs in its specific context data

Build out underlying system that would support dozens or hundreds of very small sub projects that each abided by there own spec, tracked their own information - instruction set, context,

Each small project had:
* Its own git repo - so it could be independently deployed, versioned, etc
  * a very structured approach, across all projects to enforce a git maintenance style
* An interface
* Context tracking for the agent responsible for that sub project.

Then there were numerous other parts
* A manager Agent - maintained a library (probably
* Plugin Bugs - auto addressing error cases
  * Integrate into a Metrics/Logging system to capture issues
  * Capturing Issues, logging in a project management system
  * Agent that is responsible for handling each issue
    * There is a "template" context so that each Plugin can


## Architecture

* We'll write most of the code in Python/bash, but plugins may be in other languages (javascript/node/typescript)
* Git subtrees (NOT submodules) to maintain/version each plugin

## Global Templates

`./scripts/symlnk_example.sh` comes from another project, which in a parent dir contained Agent instructions that then needed to be symlinked into another directory. 

We may want to use a similar idea where every plugin directory/repository has one or more symlinks from a parent into the plugin repo.

## Evals

Its going to be very important that we have a reliable set of instructions that all the "Plugin Agent"'s have to follow. To do that, we're going to want an evaluation process we can run that checks a series of basic tasks can be followed with our templated agent instructions and some mock/testing plugins.

The basic idea of the Eval system will be to create a series of increasingly difficult tasks, and verifying the task or tasks are completed.


## Tooling 

What are the 'cogs'/'wheels' that will work on each of the plugins and how are they going to work.
We could encode our "workflows" into something like LangChain. But a coding agent like Gemini CLI (or Claude Code) might be used in a headless style mode to handle
