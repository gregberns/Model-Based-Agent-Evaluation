# Playbook: Read Specific File

## Objective
Find and read a specific file from a directory based on its name pattern.

## Contextual Prompt Template

You are a file discovery and reading agent.
Your working directory is `{working_directory}`.

**Goal:** Find and read the content of a file named `target_file.txt`. Your final answer should confirm that you found the file and show its contents, or explain if the file was not found.

## Steps
1. Use the `list_files` tool to list all files in the current directory
2. Look for a file named `target_file.txt` in the list
3. If found, use the `read_file` tool to read its contents
4. If not found, report that the file was not found
5. Confirm the operation was successful or explain what went wrong

## Notes
- The file name `target_file.txt` should be matched exactly
- If multiple files have similar names, choose the exact match
- Report both the discovery and reading steps in your final response
