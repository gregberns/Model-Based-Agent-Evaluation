# Plugin Manager

## Problem

What if you needed to maintain a lot of plugins, or today a lot of MCP servers. How could you do that 'at scale' - meaning there are several hundred (or more)?

What challenges would you run into?

* Resources - only so many hours in a day
* Brain power - hard for a human to understand every plugin
* Error tracking and resolution - Prod errors tracked, debugged, fixed, deployed


## Structure

In `tasks` are all the thoughts on how to work through this problem - in order. There may be an 'input' and 'output' for each one - where input is taking previous 'tasks' and manually writing out what to do - then passing it to an agent (Gemini) - and then it'll go into 'output'.

## Technical Choices

I've been using Gemini CLI a lot. Its a good coding agent, so lets experiment with how we could orchestrate its use over lots of standardized things.

This ABSOLUTELY could be done differently. This may only scale so far. At some point we may need something like LangChain workflows to enforce a more formal process.

But... with something like LangChain's workflows, (I have found) you don't have the robust, well integrated tools a code agent has like Gemini.
