## Current Development Focus

### Tool Combination Validation

**Completed Combinations** ✅

- `list_files` + `read_file` - File discovery and reading (playbook_read_specific_file.md)
- `execute_shell_command` + `read_file` - Command execution and output capture (playbook_command_and_capture.md)

**Combination Validation Criteria**
- Each combination works reliably end-to-end
- State is maintained between tool calls
- Context is properly passed between steps
- Error handling works across tool boundaries

### Reasoning and Context-Based Operations

**Completed Reasoning Playbooks** ✅
- `playbook_update_description.md` - Read profile, modify description (test_playbook_update_description.py)

**In Progress Reasoning Playbooks** 🔄
- `playbook_update_version.md` - Read profile, update version
- `playbook_add_behavior.md` - Read profile, add behavioral scenario
- `playbook_remove_behavior.md` - Read profile, remove behavioral scenario

**Reasoning Validation Criteria**
- Agent correctly understands context from previous steps
- Reasoning leads to correct modifications
- Agent identifies and modifies specific fields accurately
- Edge cases handled properly (missing fields, invalid values)

### Complex Operation Development

**Progressive Complexity Build-up**
- Started with simple reasoning operations
- Gradually increasing complexity and reasoning requirements
- Each step builds on validated previous capabilities
- Focus on operations that mirror the `fix_bug` workflow

**Complex Operation Validation**
- Multi-step operations complete reliably
- Complex reasoning works correctly
- Error recovery works at each step
- Performance is reasonable

## TDD Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development Workflow
1. **Write Test** - Create failing test for new capability
2. **Implement Minimal Fix** - Make test pass with simplest solution
3. **Refactor** - Clean up implementation while keeping tests passing
4. **Repeat** - Move to next capability building on validated foundation

### Validation Strategy
- **Isolated First** - Test individual tools in isolation
- **Then Combined** - Test simple tool combinations
- **Reasoning Next** - Test context-based operations
- **Complex Final** - Test multi-step complex operations
- **Validate Each Step** - Ensure reliability at each level before advancing

### Quality Assurance
- High test coverage for all components
- Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows
- Performance tests ensure reasonable execution times
- Error handling tests validate robustness

## Contributing Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
1. **Deterministic Tests**: Add to `evaluations/deterministic/` following naming convention `test_<tool_name>.py`
2. **Agent/Playbook Tests**: Add to `evaluations/agent/` following naming convention `test_playbook_<name>.py`
3. **Use the evaluation harness** for agent tests to ensure consistent execution
4. **Follow existing test patterns** and maintain code quality standards

### Adding New Playbooks
1. **Create playbook file** in `playbooks/` with clear objective and steps
2. **Create corresponding test** in `evaluations/agent/`
3. **Define input/output contracts** clearly in the playbook
4. **Document edge cases** and error handling expectations
5. **Validate with the evaluation harness** before merging

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow TDD approach: write tests before implementing features
- Maintain separation between deterministic and agent tests
- Use type hints and comprehensive docstrings
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes
